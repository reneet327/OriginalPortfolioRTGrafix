            <article>            
            	<p>I am a highly motivated team player with over 10 years of Marketing experience using cutting edge technology in both print and web design. I am looking for a company where I can be an intricate part of a team that needs my current skills and where I can continue and grow as a designer and programmer.</p>
                <p>Besides being a marketing professional, I am also a wife, mother, step-mother, and a fur-mom. I am currently a Junior at DeVry University studying to obtain my Batchelor or Science degree in Computer Information Systems with an emphasis in Website Development.  And, if that's not enough, I am also the lead singer of the San Francisco Band, The Cocktail Monkeys.  In all of my spare time I like to read, paint, and meditate.</p>
