       <h2>What is Cryptography?</h2>
    
       <p><b>Cryptography</b> is the science of secure communications, 
          formed from the Greek words <i>krypt&#243;s</i> meaning "hidden" 
          and <i>l&#243;gos</i>, meaning "word." The first recorded use of cryptography 
          was by the Spartans who as early as 400 BC employed a cipher device called a 
          scytale to send secret communications between military 
          commanders. The scytale consisted of a tapered baton around which was wrapped 
          a piece of parchment inscribed with the message. Once unwrapped the parchment 
          appeared to contain an incomprehensible set of letters; however when wrapped 
          around another baton of identical size the original text appears.

       </p>
    
       <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid yellow; padding-bottom: 10px;">Cryptographers developed more and more ingenious systems, 
          but it was in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century that the science of cryptography took 
          off. The first major achievement was the development of rotor cipher machines. 
          An American, Edward Hebern recognized that by hardwiring alphabetic substitution in 
          the connections from one side of an electrical rotor to those on the other side and 
          cascading a collection of such rotors, alphabetic substitutions of almost any 
          complexity could be produced. German engineers independently discovered the rotor 
          concept and designed the precursors to the most famous cipher machine in history
          &ndash; the German Enigma machine which was used during World War II. The cracking 
          of the Enigma ciphers by British and Polish cryptanalysts is one of the
          greatest triumphs in the history of cryptography and played an important role in 
          the Allied victory.
