   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>The Bike the Mountains Tour rises from the town of Littleton, Colorado and
      explores the Colorado Front Range. Our tour crosses the Continental Divide 
      twice, giving you the opportunity to bike the highest paved roads in the 
      United States. This tour is a classic showcase of Colorado's Rocky Mountain 
      scenery.</p>
   <blockquote>
      "The Bike the Mountains Tour is <i>amazing</i>. I highly recommend it
      and would gladly return."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Not designed for the weekend cyclist, this tour is offered only for those
      fit enough to ride high mountain passes. We provide sag wagons and
      support. Your lodging and meals are also part of the registration fee.
      We guarantee tough climbs, amazing sights, sweaty jerseys, and lots
      of fun.</p>
   <p>This is the seventh year we've offered the Bike the Mountains Tour. It is 
      our most popular tour and riders are returning again and again. Our experienced
      tour leaders will be there to guide, help, encourage, draft, and lead you
      every stroke of the way. Come join us!</p>
   <h2>Itinerary</h2>
   <h3>Day 1</h3>
   <p>We start from the foothills above Littleton, Colorado, promptly at 9am. Be sure
      to fuel up at Kate's House of Pancakes before starting your ride. The first
      day is a chance to get your legs in shape, test your gearing, and prepare for 
      what's to come. Be aware that there are several steep grades as we climb out of 
      the valley into the Front Range. Optional side tours and shortcuts will be
      provided.</p>
   <h3>Day 2</h3>
   <p>Day 2 starts with a climb up Bear Creek Canyon to Lookout Mountain, followed
      by a swift and winding descent into the town of Golden. Refresh yourself at the
      famous Coors Brewery. You'll need the break to get yourself ready for a great 
      climb through Golden Gate Canyon to the Peak to Peak Highway, ending in the 
      gambling town of Blackhawk. Try your hand at poker and blackjack, but watch 
      your wallet.</p>
 
   <h3>Day 3</h3>
   <p>Day 3 takes you along the Peak to Peak Highway. Established in 1918 this is 
      Colorado's oldest scenic byway. This 55-mile route showcases the mountains 
      of the Front Range, providing amazing vistas from Golden Gate Canyon State Park 
      to Rocky Mountain National Park. We'll stop at Estes Park for fun and 
      refreshment. Get a good night's sleep; you'll need it the next day.</p>  
   <h3>Day 4</h3>
   <p>Now for the supreme challenge: Day 4 brings some real high-altitude cycling 
      through Rocky Mountain National Park and up Trail Ridge Road. It's an
      amazing ride, high above timberline, topping out at over 11,000 feet. Stop and
      rest at the Alpine Visitor's Center before all of that hard work is rewarded
      with a fast and joyous descent into the town of Grand Lake.</p>
   <h3>Day 5</h3>
   <p>We start Day 5 on the west side of the Continental Divide. From Grand Lake,
      you'll bike to Winter Park, a great ski town summer resort. From Winter Park it's 
      a steady and scenic climb over Berthoud Pass, and back to the eastern side of 
      the Continental Divide. We'll stay at Idaho Springs, where you can enjoy the 
      natural hot springs at the hotel.</p>
   <h3>Day 6</h3>
   <p>On Day 6 choose your pleasure or your poison. You can ride back to Littleton
      over Squaw Pass and Bear Creek. The ride is beautiful and enjoyable in its
      own right. However, if you're "up" to it, this is your opportunity to tackle
      Mount Evans. The 7-mile side trip to the top of Mt Evans, at over 14,000 feet,
      is something that can't be found anywhere else in the country. We'll provide
      the sag wagon, you provide the legs and lungs.</p>
   <p>Once you're back to Littleton, please join us for a celebratory dinner 
      as we share memories of an amazing 6 days of riding the Colorado mountains.</p>
