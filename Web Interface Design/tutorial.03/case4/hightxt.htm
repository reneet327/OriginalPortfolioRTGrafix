      <p>The <em>Highlands Tour</em> continues to be our most popular tour. This
         two-week excursion takes you to some of the most awe-inspiring
         scenery in Scotland; yet provides plenty of shopping time and sight-seeing
         in the beautiful city of Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>The trip begins with two days in Glencoe, the site of the famous
         massacre of the MacDonald clan by the Stewarts. Take some time to go hiking.
         Several movies have been filmed in Glencoe, including <em>Braveheart</em> and
         <em>Highlander</em>. Maybe you'll get a chance to be an extra in this year's
         production!</p>
      <p>From Glencoe, the tour travels north, following the trail of Bonnie
         Prince Charlie to Glenfinnan. You'll also take a boat trip to view castle
         ruins along the Kyle of Lochalsh. A trip to Loch Ness follows. Perhaps
         you'll see Nessie!</p>
      <p>For city-dwellers, you'll enjoy the next three days in Edinburgh. Do some
         shopping along the Royal Mile, or climb Arthur's Seat for a awesome view of
         the city. If you love castles, visit Edinburgh castle and Sterling castle too.</p>
      <p>The tour concludes with a trip to Glasgow.</p>
