      <p>Do you like castles? The <em>Castles of Scotland Tour</em> is for you. The
         tour visits 15 differents castles in central and northern Scotland. The tour
         starts with the famous Edinburgh Castle, and <em>Travel Scotland!</em> has a
         special arrangement to visit parts of the castle normally closed to the
         public.</p>
      <p>From Edinburgh you travel to Stirling Castle with breathtaking views of
         the River Forth as it divides Scotland's Highlands and Lowlands. Inverness
         is next on the Itinerary with a side trip to Culloden to view where the
         campaign of Bonnie Prince Charlie came to an end.</p>
      <p>Look for Nessie from Castle Urquhart on the banks of Loch Ness. From there
         goes into the heart of the Highlands with trips to Fort William and Oban. We've
         made special plans to picnic by Castle Stalker near Glencoe.</p>
      <p>No castle tour would be complete with a trip to Balmacara Castle on the
         Isle of Skye. While on Skye, we'll have a boat trip along the feet of the
         Black Cullins.</p>
      <p>The tour concludes with two days back in Edinburgh for shopping, additional
         site-seeing, or just rest and relaxation.</p>
