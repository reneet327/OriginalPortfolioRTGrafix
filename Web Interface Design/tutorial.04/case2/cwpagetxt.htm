   <h2>Lincoln's Second Inaugural</h2>
   <div id="article">
      <p>
       At this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there 
       is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then 
       a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and 
       proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations 
       have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest 
       which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little 
       that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly 
       depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably 
       satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in 
       regard to it is ventured.
     </p>
     <p>
        On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously 
        directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While 
        the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving 
        the Union without war, urgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without 
        war—seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated 
        war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other 
        would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.
     </p>
     <p>
        One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over 
        the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a 
        peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the 
        war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the 
        insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to 
        do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for 
        the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated 
        that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should 
        cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. 
        Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. 
        It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their 
        bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The 
        prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty 
        has His own purposes. "Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that 
        offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh." If we shall suppose that 
        American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, 
        but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He 
        gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense 
        came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers 
        in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty 
        scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth 
        piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until 
        every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was 
        said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the Lord are true and 
        righteous altogether."
      </p>
      <p>
        With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to 
        see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, 
        to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all 
        which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.
