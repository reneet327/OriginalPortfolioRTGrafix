         <p>Thank you for considering donating your time and talents to The
            Lighthouse. While we always welcome financial support, we cannot
            continue to serve the public without volunteers like you.
         </p>
         <p>Please fill out the form on this page indicating your interests
            and talents. Everyone has something to offer, so don't be shy.
            And remember, we can always teach you, so don't let inexperience
            keep you away.</p>
         <p>While you are helping others, you too will gain from the experience.
            Many of our volunteers have been with us for years. One of our
            volunteers told me the other day, "Terry, The Lighthouse has
            given more to me than I have ever given to it."</p>
         <p>Welcome to the team!</p>
         <p>&mdash; Terry Ives<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Director, <i>The Lighthouse</i></p>
         <p>P.S. Please consider a <a href="#">financial donation</a>
            to help us continue to support our neighbors in the community.</p>
