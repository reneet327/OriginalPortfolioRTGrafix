   <h1 style="color: blue">Contest Winners</h1>
   <p>Here are the results for this month's contest for best photos
      in the categories of <i>Child Photos</i>, <i>Flower Photos</i>, and
      <i>Scenic Photos</i>. I received hundreds of entries and it was 
      difficult to narrow the entries down to three in each category. Thanks to everyone
      who participated this month.</p>
   <p>Below are thumbnail images of the winning photos. You can click the
      photos to view larger images of each. These photos are distributed
      for non-commercial use. If you wish to obtain copies for commercial
      use, please contact the photographer.</p>
   <p>Next month's contest categories:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Animal Photos</li>
      <li>Nighttime Photos</li>
      <li>Sports Photos</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Please submit your entries to
      Gerry Hayward.</p>
   <p>
      Include your name, the photo category, and the photo settings. JPEG photos only.
      Please keep the file size &lt; 100k. My mail server will reject photos larger
      than 100k. One entry per person please.
